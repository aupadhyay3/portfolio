                                        whether it be a tricky math problem or a bug in my code. Although it's quite difficult to believe that anyone would enjoy a process
                                      as cumbersome as debugging, rather I like to think of it as a road block on the way to developing a feature that I'm so excited about
                                    that I'll stop at nothing to break down that road block. I'm most content when I achieve a state of flow while working on something that is both challenging
                                  and something I'm passionate about. Aside from the satisfaction of knowing I worked through difficult problems, I aspire to work on difficult, <span style="color: #FFA62B; font-weight:bold";>meaningful</span> problems
                                whose solutions will help people better interact with their worlds and ultimately create a positive impact in people's lives. </p>

                                              Python IDE to teach young
                                              users how to code in order to change aspects of their design including nail color, nail sticker position, etc.</p></br>
                                            <b>Coding Skills: <span style="color: #FFA62B">HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python</span></b></br>
                                            <b>Outcome: </b>Beta-tested with young users and observed their interactions with the application
                                               in order to design an optimal UI/UX. Presented a final prototype of the project at an investor meeting with Adobe and
                                               executed all features seamlessly.</br>
                                            <b>Reflection: </b>This project taught me a large amount of a skill I call <span style="color: #FFA62B">technical resourcefulness</span>. Although I had some experience with
                                              HTML and CSS, I ultimately ended up teaching myself
                                              Javascript as we incorporated new features that required the language. For example, for the user to be able to drag and drop a nail sticker
                                              onto the manicure or resize the sticker, I did substantial research until this feature was incorporated to our taste.

                                              Because I was so <span style="color: #FFA62B">passionate about teaching children how to code</span> and exposing them to STEM at a young age, it made putting extra hours
                                              into this project feel 100% worth it. I learned that when I’m passionate about a project, it tends to be the main thing on my mind as
                                              I would come home from work and continue coding and debugging even during my summer break.

                                              Additionally, I learned how to better <span style="color: #FFA62B">collaborate with others</span> as I worked on a team with three other college CS majors. Together, we went through the process of
                                               brainstorming, wireframing, prototyping, developing, testing, and repeating the cycle while utilizing everyone’s strengths throughout the
                                                process. By the end of the summer, even though I was the least experienced, I ended up pushing a substantial amount of

                                            <b>Outcome: </b>A Pac-man style game with an engine that can randomly render a valid game tile sequence based

                                            <b>Reflection: </b>
                                            This project required fine <span style="color: #FFA62B">software engineering skills</span> as we went through the process of
                                            ideating and testing and rebuilding several times. The process of generating a valid game board randomly was certainly
                                            the most challenging aspect. We brainstormed approaches that seemed simple enough for humans, yet when it came to coding
                                            these aspects, they were quite challenging. We ended up having to delete large chunks of code and rethinking our process
                                            multiple times. Although this process was frustrating, we ultimately built a game engine that generated a random game
                                            board that was fully valid every single time while maintaining an efficient run time. This project was a partner project
                                            so I learned a lot about <span style="color: #FFA62B">partner coding</span>. This was a quarantine project, so we weren’t
                                            able to code side by side. Rather, we
                                            delegated aspects of the project based on parts that wouldn’t conflict with one another and regrouped every day if not every few hours.
                                            We were able to correct each other’s mistakes and help each other become unstuck and I was really happy with my experience
                                            with collaborating while coding. Certainly the project would take several more hours if I didn’t have a partner to bounce ideas off and
                                            debug together. Also, through <span style="color: #FFA62B">explaining my code</span> to my partner, the concepts became extremely clear in my head and we were able to point out flaws in our ideation which
                                            was extremely helpful for our learning.

                                          This project allowed me to deeply understand <span style="color: #FFA62B">KD Trees</span>
                                            and the <span style="color: #FFA62B">A* algorithm</span>. The trickiest method in terms of the
                                          KD Tree class was the nearest method which returns the closest point to the inputted coordinates, taking
                                          <span style="color: #FFA62B">O(log(n))</span>
                                           time on average, where N is the total number of points in the KD Tree. After going through a few examples of
                                           identifying the nearest point by hand, I was able to create a recursive algorithm for nearest which picked the
                                           optimal direction in the k-dimensional space where it would be most likely to find the nearest point. I improved the
                                            method to “prune” or not visit any branch that was guaranteed to return a point that wasn’t as close as the
                                             current closest point.  Through building this map system, I was able to understand the practical application
                                             of a tree that partitions points in a k-dimensional space, making it easier to locate the nearest point
                                             or region on a map.

                                             The A* algorithm was key to building my <span style="color: #FFA62B">artificial intelligence system that solves
                                              arbitrary state
                                             space traversal problems</span>. Specifically, given a graph of possible states, the AI finds the optimal
                                            route from the start state to a goal state using A* and a well-defined heuristic. As I ran through more examples,
                                              it became clear that modifying the heuristic, or the estimated distance between two points, led to substantial
                                            improvements in A* generating the best path more efficiently. For example, if you know the given destination
                                              is due east, you don’t want your algorithm to traverse due west for any reason even if there is a nearby node.
                                              I used a minimum priority queue to store the vertex and the sum of vertex’s distance from the source plus the
                                              heuristic estimate from the vertex to the goal destination. Ultimately, this project was very helpful in
                                              incorporating multiple data structures in a practical way especially since it made me more appreciative of
                                              Google Maps which likely uses similar <span style="color: #FFA62B">data structures and algorithms</span> although
                                              obviously much more efficiently and effectively.

                                          This project was great for understanding Scheme on a deeper level since I developed code that
                                          evaluates all of the key Scheme commands. There’s no better way to understand how a function works
                                           than to make it yourself! There were several commands that the interpreter was able to perform
                                           such as <span style="color: #FFA62B">define, lookup, eval, begin, lambda, if/and/or</span>, determining
                                             whether the code is a valid procedure, and more.

                                           I also gained insight into what some of our IDE’s are doing behind the scenes and had a lot
                                           more appreciation for those who work on developing such environments. A lot of thought must go into each
                                            decision so that it’s simple for coders to build a program without worrying that their if statement won’t
                                             evaluate correctly or anything like that. It also showed me the power of Python as it can serve as
                                             a interpreter for other languages if planned correctly along with its countless other applications.

                                          <b>Outcome: </b>Deployed the app on my personal device and upgraded it to have different

                                          <b>Reflection: </b>
                                          This was my first project using Android SDK which was a substantial shift from my work
                                           in Java and Python. Although it is very similar to Java, I learned a lot about the <span style="color: #FFA62B">activity
                                            life cycle</span> for Android apps. I also gained a better understanding of <span style="color: #FFA62B">object oriented programming</span>
                                             as each aspect of the game could be represented as different objects, such as GameEngine, World,
                                              EnemySprite, etc., which made creating a big game with lots of interacting parts a lot simpler.
                                               By honing in on what you want each object to do and narrowing it down to which methods must be
                                                incorporated, I was able to take a <span style="color: #FFA62B">large problem, break it down into parts, and finally put
                                                 all the elements together</span> to build a modified Angry Birds game!

                                          This project was an entry for the Website Design competition for FBLA for which the prompt was to
                                          develop a website that helps users with the job search process. With such an open ended prompt,
                                          our team brainstormed which features we deemed would be the most helpful for a potential job
                                          candidate after doing a lot of research about the industry. We compiled content from the most
                                          trustworthy sources and learned a lot ourselves in the process.
                                          Furthermore, we worked to develop the best possible <span style="color: #FFA62B">user interface and experience</span> for convenience. We had
                                          people of several ages interact with our website in order to determine which features were effective and
                                          which needed more work. We also put together a 10 minute pitch for our website, explaining each of our
                                          decisions about design, content, accessibility, etc. to professional web developers who gave us very
                                          insightful feedback. Overall, the process was very enriching as our team was able to develop a whole
                                           product from start to finish given just a basic prompt.

                    <p>For the past year, I've been a DeCal Facilitator for a class called <span style="color: #FFA62B">TeaCal: An Exploration of Mindfulness and Meditation</span>.
                    A DeCal is a 1 unit class led by UC Berkeley students, and I teach this class along with three other Cal students. Along with my passion for <span style="color: #FFA62B">tea</span>, I really enjoyed
                  the class as I remember feeling a sense of calmness and total awareness when I first joined the DeCal and steeped tea myself. I hope to continue this course for
                all of my future semesters as Berkeley, with the hope of teaching other students about how they can apply mindfulness to their lives and hopefully notice a change in
              their life as I have ever since I practiced <span style="color: #FFA62B">meditation</span> more regularly. I am particularly interested in Chan or Zen Meditation, my most common practice being silent sitting meditation.
              <p>Additionally, I love to play and watch <span style="color: #FFA62B">basketball</span>. This year I'm in a fantasy basketball league so I've been able to catch more games than usual
                      with the hopes of watching my roster's players put up some awesome stats. In general, I love to be outdoors whether it be playing ball, <span style="color: #FFA62B">spikeball</span>, hiking, etc.
                    Another interest of mine is trying new foods and drinks! Thus far, I must say my favorites are vegetable pho, vegan sushi, and just about any type of boba.</p>
            Here is a video of a steeping of Alishan Oolong Tea from when I visited Lake Tahoe and some quotes from past students:</br></p>
